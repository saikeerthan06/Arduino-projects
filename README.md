  1. This is the README for the final and updated version of EZ-Lock with added security features.
  2. EZ-Lock now needs a OTP to open, which will be generated by the program and given to the delivery person. Once the correct OTP has been entered, the box will open and the owner will get a notification when the box is opened.
     The house owner will then get a confirmation message that a parcel has been delivered when the delivery person pushes the button and the box closes. 
  4. If any suspicious activity is reported, for example, when someone tries to open the box by incorrectly guessing the OTP too many times, a security alert will be sent to the house owner where the details such as the time and
     the location will also be shown.
